# Hackerrank
This repository contains answers to the Hackerrank challenges.

## SQL
### Easy
- [Draw The Triangle 1](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Easy/Draw%20The%20Triangle%201.md): use of DECLARE and WHILE loop to draw triangle in a loop
- [Draw The Triangle 2](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Easy/Draw%20The%20Triangle%202.md): use of DECLARE and WHILE loop to draw triangle in a loop in a reverse order


### Medium
- [Weather Observation Station 20](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Weather%20Observation%20Station%2020.md): use of MAX to determine median latitude 
- [The PADS](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/The%20PADS.md): use of CONCAT to concatenate string values
- [Occupations](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Occupations.md): use of PIVOT to pivot table
- [Binary Tree Nodes](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Binary%20Tree%20Nodes.md): use of CASE to determine node types
- [Print Prime Numbers](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Print%20Prime%20Numbers.md): use of procedural clauses, WHILE loop & IF statement to determine prime numbers in a loop
- [Symmetric Pairs](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Symmetric%20Paris.md): use of SELF JOIN to find symmetric pairs
- [The Report](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Easy/The%20Report.md): use of CTE and UNION (union with distinct rows & union all with duplicated rows) to create a student grade report
- [Challenges](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Challenges.md): use of CTE and UNION to organise information of hacker who created challenges
- [Placements](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Medium/Placements.md): use of JOIN to compare student salaries

### Hard
- [Interviews](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Hard/Interviews.md): use of CTE to aggregate values before join
- [15 Days of Learning SQL](https://github.com/TravisH0301/hackerrank/blob/main/SQL/Hard/15%20Days%20of%20Learning%20SQL.md): use of CTE and ROW_NUMBER to aggregate and filter using row numbers
